The leaflet document class
==========================

A LaTeX document class to create small hand-outs (flyers) that fit on a
single sheet of paper which is then folded twice. Pages are rearranged by
LaTeX so that they print correctly on a single sheet -- no external script
is necessary. (Works with PostScript and PDF.)

Recommended TDS locations:
```
   leaflet.cls:                     tex/latex/leaflet
   leaflet.pdf,leaflet-manual.pdf:  doc/latex/leaflet
```
For general installation advice, see
